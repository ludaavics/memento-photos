Hi, I’m Tatiana. I’m passionate about photos, and the way pictures help us remember the most meaningful moments of our lives.

Yet, I know that most of us today have way too many pictures to manage. If you feel overwhelmed by your photos and never seem to find the time to do anything meaningful with them, you are certainly not alone!

My hope with Memento Photos is to help you organize your precious memories, and turn them into beautiful photobooks that you will be able to share with your loved ones. You can find some useful tips and tricks about getting started making your own albums here. Or you can contact me, and I will be happy to manage the entire process for you, from sorting your pictures to getting your album printed and shipped. I am looking forward helping you achieve your photobook goals!
