Hi, I'm Tatiana. I'm passionate about photos, and the way pictures help us remember
the most meaningful moments of our lives.

I always enjoyed sorting pictures, making photobooks and flipping through the stories
and memories that albums tell. But when I became a mom to 2 adorable kiddos, I started
seeing even more value in making photo albums, and documenting the way my children
change and grow every day.
Still, life with little kids was so busy that I never seemed to find the time to make
albums or use my pictures in any meaningful way. The photos of my kids were only living
on my phone, unsorted, disorganized and pretty much useless. I felt like I was drowning
in them, completely overwhelmed.

Most of us today have way too many photos to manage, and finding the time to sort our
pictures and organize them into beautiful albums that we can hold in your hands and
line up on your bookshelf seems completely unrealistic.
If you feel that way, you are certainly not alone!

My hope with Memento Photos is to help you organize your precious memories, and turn
them into meaningful photobooks that you will be able to share with your loved ones.
You can find some useful tips and tricks about getting started making your own albums
here, or contact me to discuss how I can help you achieve your photobook goals!
