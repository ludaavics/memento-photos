Not everyone likes to take pictures. Fewer people still would ever consider taking the
time to turn those pictures into a photobook. But pretty much everyone I know would
enjoy receiving a photobook as a gift. It is probably the most thoughtful, personal
and special gift you could dream of. It shows that the person who made the book truly
treasures those shared memories, that they thought of you and spent time making
something that would make you happy. And once you receive the photobook, you can keep
looking at it, share it with friends and family, and even display it in your home, so
you’re constantly reminded of the love and attention of the gift-giver. Isn’t that
something we all want to experience?

Over the years, I have gifted many photobooks. A photobook retracing my friendship
with my best friend, to thank her for being my maid of honor. A photobook of a shared
trip to Naples, to thank friends who took the trip for joining in my birthday
festivities there. A photobook of my mother-in-law’s best pictures with my son, to
tell her she was about to become a grandmother to a second baby.

When it comes to gifting a photobook, the possibilities are endless. You can make one
as an engagement proposal, or as a gift to celebrate your child’s latest milestone,
you can have one waiting by the Christmas tree for you spouse, to celebrate one more
year spent together, or offer one to your parents after a memorable trip or holiday
spent in their company.

Whatever the situation, I would keep in mind the following things:

### 1. Choose your occasion carefully

Just like any other gift, a photobook can become repetitive or expected, so try to
choose your occasion carefully. Ideally, you want it to be a surprise and to be
memorable (just like in my example of announcing a pregnancy, or making an
engagement proposal).

### 2. Plan ahead

Making a photobook takes time, so give yourself plenty of room, to avoid being rushed
at the last minute. I would say, the ideal timeline would be: 2 weeks to make the
photobook, 1 solid week for printing and delivery and 1 week extra, just in case.
Therefore, I would recommend you **start your photobook 1 month before the day when
you want to offer it**.

### 3. See it from their point of view

When you make the book, remember your audience: the person you are making it for may
have tastes that are different from your own. Keep their perspective in mind when
choosing and arranging your pictures.

 * Most people like to look at pictures of themselves, so make sure you are including
  plenty of those, and make sure they are flattering.
* If you know that they love certain pictures, even if they are not your own favorites,
  make sure you include them, and feature them prominently.
* Finally, if their aesthetic taste is different from your own, make sure you take that
  into consideration as well. My Dad, for example, really likes repetitive layouts,
  with 1 to 4 pictures per page, so I try not to stray too far away from that when I
  make a photobook for him.

If you do decide to make a photobook for a loved one, congratulations! Be sure you are
going to make them very happy, and give them a gift they will treasure for years to come.
